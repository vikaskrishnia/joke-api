Goal:
I would like to build a sample golang app which exposes common metrics at /metrics endpoint for observability.

Context:
The golang app should be able to tell a random joke in the language of my choice and the metrics should have at least response time, response code captured 

Desired Output:
Output of golang app should be json and /metrics should respond the metrics for the golang app
